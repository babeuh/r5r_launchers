## Note [Important]

1. This is not a cheat or hack. Do not attempt to use this on the latest version of the game

2. All this code was blatently stolen form the official [detours_r5](https://github.com/Mauler125/detours_r5) repo

## Why

1. The normal r5reloaded launcher doesn't work on linux

### Launching

1. Build the solution
   * or get the binaries from the releases page of this repo
2. Copy `R5R Dev Launcher.exe` and `R5R Rel Launcher.exe` to the apex game folder
3. Run one of the launchers
